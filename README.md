This creates a <textarea> element with the id attribute set to "speechToText." It provides a text input area where the converted text from the voice input will be displayed. The rows and cols attributes determine the number of visible rows and columns in the textarea.

This is a <button> element labeled "Voice to Text." When clicked, it triggers the voice() JavaScript function to start converting voice to text.

The voice() function is defined to handle voice recognition and text conversion.
It creates a SpeechRecognition object using the webkitSpeechRecognition constructor if available or the standard SpeechRecognition constructor.
The recognition.lang property is set to "en-GB," specifying that the recognition should be in British English.
The recognition.onresult event handler is defined to handle the recognition results. When speech is recognized, it logs the event to the console and sets the value of the "speechToText" textarea to the recognized transcript.
Finally, the recognition.start() method is called to start listening for voice input when the button is clicked.
